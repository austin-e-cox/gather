              Welcome to Gather! A site that connects us to one another through technology and creativity. 
              These days, it can be hard to find fun and meaningful interactions with people outside of our normal social circle.
               Gather is here to help with that! Gather is a great platform that brings people who share common interests together, allowing users to connect on a level that is not only fun but also encourages social growth. 
               Connect with users around the country to come together and have in depth discussions about subjects that you care about. Chat with users hundreds of miles away for some simple cooking tips and tricks! Have a conversation with someone in an entirely different place that you would never have thought to have common ground with. 
              Whether you want to share ideas, hobbies, or just want to find people to have a good laugh with, Gather is here to help.
                            </p>
